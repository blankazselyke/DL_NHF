# Airbus ship detection

## Dreamteam2024 team
## Team members: Horváth Dóra (F0B9YK), Kiss Blanka Zselyke (C6037J), Nyiri Balázs (REMAIO)

### Project Description
The aim of the project is to segment ships based on satellite images. The data was downloaded from the Kaggle Airbus Ship Detection Challenge page (kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection). We have access to images as well as masks corresponding to the bounding boxes around the ships, encoded with RLE (Run-Length Encoding).
